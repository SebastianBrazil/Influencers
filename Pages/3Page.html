I don't remember the whole day, I don't even remember if it was indeed the 3rd, but that day we went to church. It was a little church near where Brenda lived and it was around our third time going. Afterwards we went back to her house. Her youngest brother, Aaron, had a school project where he had to make a display model based off a book about a Native American tribe. <br> <br> Brenda promised to help her brother and since I was there, I helped out too. While he made models of people out of play dough, Brenda and I had glued fake grass to the outside of styrofoam cones and called them teepees. Of course, they looked nothing like teepees, but I had a lot of fun doing that with her. We were sitting on the floor and making just an absolute mess everywhere. In the end, we got a dustpan and broom and did the best we could to clean up, which was more difficult that expected because of some glue on the floor. It's a lovely memory to me. I felt at home. Brenda, thank you for everything.</p>
