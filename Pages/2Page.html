When Brenda got her bangs she asked me if she looked like Dora. :p <br> <br> There are many qualities that my comrade has. All of them helped me when I was struggling in life, and they still help me in growing to become a better person. Brenda's: <br> Kind - she's always been willing to lend a hand to me even when we were little more than strangers, <br> Compassionate - she listens to my problems even when she has her own problems, and even if she can't do anything herself to help me, <br> Hard-working - going to Delta College for real estate while having a job is no easy task, yet Brenda still does both in order to achieve her dreams and help out her family,<br> Patient - I can be incredibly annoying at times yet she doesn't take out her frustrations on me, <br> Strong - last but not least, Brenda has been through a lot, much more than I have, yet she still pushes on in life. Even this alone is enough reason for me to look up to her. Brenda, thank you for everything.</p>
