        <p class="text-base lg:text-xl purpleColor marg">For a while, Brenda and I have been trying to give each other nicknames. Brenda isn't great with coming up with nicknames, and so "Buddha" has stuck, for now, because I said it once. To be fair, actually I'll explain when that happened. 
        <p class="text-base lg:text-xl purpleColor marg">We went to Los Angeles late in October to visit Universal Studios for my birthday. My birthday was mid September but whatevs. So Brenda and I were chilling at the pool of the hotel we were staying at, and it was there where we were trying to think of names. She says her nickname is "BrendaBeThuggin", which I don't really consider a nickname, and she was trying to give me a nickname like "SebastianTheTherapist", which I also don't consider a nickname. I'm also not a therapist, for better or for worse. I said I'd rather have a name like Buddha instead of that, and it kinda stuck. </p>
        <p class="text-base lg:text-xl purpleColor marg">I couldn't come of with a nickname for her then and there. Afterwords I eventually picked up "Brendy" as a sillier way to say Brenda, but I felt like that wasn't enough. I suppose I should explain my basis for a nickname. I feel like nicknames that have the actual person's name in them aren't creative enough. It's why I let "Buddha" stick and why I have officially thought of a new and proper nickname for my dear Brendy: <br> TabbyCat!</p>
        <p class="text-base lg:text-xl purpleColor marg">Okay so I've been writing a lot, and truth be told I don't actually like writing. But I like writing about Brenda. I came up with the name "TabbyCat" and its iterations of "Tabby" and "Cat", quite recently. I'd say March 9th-ish, yesterday as I'm writing this. Brenda is such a curious soul. In this case, I mean she's very curious about everything around her. Problem is it gets her into a lot of trouble, very often. Curiosity kills the cat, some may say, and BOOM! There's her nickname. "Cat" would have been too simple, so I was thinking: tabby cats hold a special place in my heart. I mean, I love cats, but the word Tabby lives rent-free in my head, so I ended up added tabby: "TabbyCat"! What a beautiful name. At least I think so :) </p>
        <p class="text-base lg:text-xl purpleColor marg">And for such a beautiful person too! As always, Brenda, thank you for everything.</p>
