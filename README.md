Influential Person Website

Designed at 1440 by 900 pixels. This website is dedicated to an influential person in my life. Created with four pages, it utilizes Tailwind CSS as a library. 

1/22/24: I created the home page for the website, hopefully the rest of the pages go along smoothly. 1/23/24 part 1: Fleshed out all of the pages for desktop and did one page of mobile, still need to work the other mobile pages. 1/23/24 part 2: Completed all mobile pages, the project is good to go. I wanted to add this project to Vercel even though it isn't required (I believe), ran into an error in part one so I believe that this push should fix that. I will never forget to look at Vercel again. 1/24/24: I wish Vercel was easier. 1/24/24 part 2: I throw in the towel with Vercel. Scrapped every commit after "commit before i break something" because oh yeah I broke stuff.

I like the design choice with the hello kitty and I like how simplistic the design is but it shows your appreciation for Brenda. I liked all the little jokes you threw into your project and it worked pretty good and was responsive. Good Job!
